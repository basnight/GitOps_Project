# GitOps and ArgoCD Complete Hands-on Project

In this comprehensive hands-on project, we dive deep into the world of GitOps and ArgoCD, demonstrating how to implement these essential DevOps practices step by step.

🐳 Dockerizing the Todo Application: We begin by containerizing the Todo application, ensuring it's ready to be deployed and managed efficiently.

☁️ Provisioning EKS Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform: Next, we'll guide you through provisioning an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on AWS using Terraform custom modules. Learn best practices for infrastructure as code.

🔄 Implementing CI with CircleCI: Continuous Integration (CI) is crucial to modern software development. Discover how to set up a robust CI pipeline using CircleCI, automating your code integration process.

🌐 GitOps with ArgoCD: GitOps is a game-changer in managing Kubernetes environments. I will show you how to leverage ArgoCD to automate application deployment and synchronization with your Git repository.

🛠️ Fixing Errors in Real-Time: Throughout this video, we'll encounter common challenges and errors that can occur in real-world scenarios. Watch as we troubleshoot and resolve these issues, providing valuable insights into debugging and problem-solving.
